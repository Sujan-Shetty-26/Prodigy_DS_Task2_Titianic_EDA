Titanic Dataset Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a data analysis on the Titanic dataset, which is a popular dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their survival status, age, gender, ticket class, and more.
# Introduction
The Titanic dataset is often used for data analysis and machine learning projects. The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.
# Data Cleaning
The dataset may contain missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. In this section, we address these issues to ensure the data is suitable for analysis. The cleaning.ipynb notebook contains the code and explanations for the data cleaning process.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing and understanding the data. The eda.ipynb notebook explores relationships between variables, visualizes patterns, and draws insights from the dataset. This section helps in forming hypotheses for further analysis.
